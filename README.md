# FoodDiary
FoodDiary is a demo iOS app built with SwiftUI and SwiftData for tracking daily food intake and nutritional values.  
The project focuses on solid engineering principles and taking an idea from concept to a working demo rather than visual polish.

## Features

### Favorites

 + Favorites can be quickly added to daily meals  
### Settings

## Future developments

 + Food search
 + Improved accessibility
 + Additional test coverage

## Notes
This project was built for my personal portfolio.

It aims to showcase:
 + The ability to take a project from an idea to a finished, working demo
 + Clear separation of concerns
 + Code that is easy to read and maintain
 + Use of modern Apple frameworks
