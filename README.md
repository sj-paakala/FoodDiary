# Food Diary
Food Diary is a demo iOS app built and tested with Xcode 26 for iOS 26 using SwiftUI and SwiftData. The app is designed to track daily food intake and nutritional values. 

The project focuses on solid engineering principles and taking an idea from concept to a working demo rather than visual polish.

## Notes
This project was built for my personal portfolio.

It aims to showcase:

 + Clear separation of concerns
 + Code that is easy to read and maintain
 + Use of modern Apple frameworks

## Folder structure
Inside App/FoodDiary folder:
+ App - Application entry point
+ Features - Feature-oriented SwiftUI views and logic
+ Models - SwiftData models
+ Resources - Launch screen and app icon files
+ Shared - Shared views and reusable components
+ Utilities - Formatting and parsing helpers

Unit and UI tests are included, with limited coverage.

## Installation
+ Clone the repository
+ Open the FoodDiary Xcode project inside App folder
+ Select iOS simulator or physical iPhone (iOS 26 recommended)
+ Build and run in Xcode

## Use of AI Tools

AI tools were used during development as a support for:
+ Reasoning about SwiftUI and SwiftData architecture
+ Debugging compiler errors and edge cases
+ Refactoring and improving code clarity

All code was reviewed, understood, and adapted manually.  
Final design decisions, implementation, and testing were done by me.
